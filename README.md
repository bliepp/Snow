# Snow
A little snow simulation with Python3 and PyGame. When executed, the app goes to fullscreen mode and snow begins to fall. You can start and stop generating new snow with the spacebar. Your memory won't overflow: Snow that gets out of the screen is going to be destructed. If you wan't to exit the app, click `Esc`.

## What to use for
You could use this as a screen saver (if you know how to convert it, Windows: Rename .exe to .scr) or as a live video background. I also made an infinite FullHD video loop with start and stop sequences to use in your favourite video editor. I also retouched it a little bit to give it a smoother look.

## It's your time!
Feel free to fork, extend and publish it. You could probably change the shape of the snow.

I'm also looking for people building executables for other OSes, so unexperienced users are able to play it without installing and handling Python. The executables are packaged with _PyInstaller_.
